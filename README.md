My Final Year Project at Kingston University

Zeno is a project where I implemented game mechanics found in open world RPGs. The player is able to move around, attack, defend, talk to NPCs, buy items and complete quests. There are enemies in the game which were implemented using state machines and I used a JSON database to store dialogs, quests and item data.

I implemented the following game mechanics:

Dialog system

Quest system

Inventory system

Combat system

Shop system

Hostile AI

The Game was created using Unity and written in C#
